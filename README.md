server.py contains contributions from:

* Abram Hindle
* Eddie Antonio Santos
* Connor Resler
* Ryan Satyabrata - I read his code found here: https://github.com/kobitoko/CMPUT404-assignment-webserver/blob/master/server.py#L45 to help me understand how to approach aspects of the assignment. I also used some code directly from here, which is referenced in my code 

I referenced the following webpages for help with understanding concepts and how to write code using certain functions:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#module-time
https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html
https://docs.python.org/2/library/mimetypes.html

https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html
https://github.com/enthought/Python-2.7.3/blob/master/Lib/SimpleHTTPServer.py

But the server.py example is derived from the python documentation
examples thus some of the code is Copyright Â© 2001-2013 Python
